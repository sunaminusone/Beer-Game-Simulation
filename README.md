# 🍺 Beer Game Simulation

Welcome to the **Beer Game Simulation**, a supply chain modeling project that compares different inventory ordering policies under the classic beer game scenario.

This project explores how different strategies manage the **bullwhip effect**, total cost, and inventory dynamics across a 4-tier supply chain:

- 🛒 Retailer  
- 🏪 Distributor  
- 🏭 Manufacturer  
- 🛢️ Supplier

## ⚙️ Strategies Implemented

| Strategy Name      | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🤖 **RLOM**         | Reinforcement Learning Ordering Mechanism using Q-learning                 |
| 🧬 **GA-Based**     | Fixed policy derived from a Genetic Algorithm approximation                |
| 🔁 **1-for-1**      | Classic policy: order exactly what was received from downstream            |

## 🧪 How to Run the Simulation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the experiment comparison
python experiments/compare_policies.py
```

This will generate interactive Plotly visualizations and save them to the `results/` folder.

## 📊 Visualizations (saved as .html)

- 📦 `inventory.html` — Inventory Over Time by Role
- 🛍️ `orders.html` — Orders Over Time by Role
- 💸 `costs.html` — Period Costs Over Time
- 🧾 `total_costs_comparison.html` — Bar chart of total cost across strategies
- 📈 `cumulative_costs_over_time.html` — Line chart of cost accumulation over time

All files are saved in `results/` and can be opened in any browser.
